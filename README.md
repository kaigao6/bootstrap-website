App description: Using the Bootstrap 4 Framework, I built a three page responsive website about Climate Change and what people can do to help prevent it.

The home page has a Bootstrap JumboTron feature.
You can help page uses Bootstrap Card feature to list six simple things with imgages that people can do to help the organization fight climate change.
Contact us page has map image for the fictitious organizationâ€™s address using the Google Static Maps API as well as a contact form (Bootstrap form feature) that asks users for their name, email address, and allows them to write a message in a textarea and upload files.

All three pages have the same navigation menu. The menu is responsive and switches to the hamburger style collapsing menu at the mobile size.
Every page has the same footer. There is a copyright notice, as well as four links to different social media sites: Twitter, Facebook,Instagram and Linkedin.  The Social Media links use the icons that represent each site. Each of the icons changes colour when user hovers over the link.
